Study Hypothesis/what is eQTL mapping? - answered in 01-introduction.md
Where We Are Going - describe Attie experiment, hypothesis, study design & key results
Data Preparation (or have data ready) What do we need? - revisit smcclatchy.github.io/mapping for these steps
QTL analysis (and what does it mean?) The same as before? - compare/contrast QTL with eQTL
Mediation Analysis – What is it? What does it do?
Result Interpretation (Sue Example) - now do some of this yourself


1. introduce eqtl mapping - what is it, why is it used?
2. introduce Attie data and describe Attie experiment, hypothesis, study design & key results
3. explore data - summarized data, matrices w/sample annotation, exp data, gene annotation, like bioconductor summarized experiment etc = whole set of rectangles
4. look at distribution of data and transformation to rankZ
5. review mapping steps w/ one simple pheno - choose wisely to get a nice peak
6. map 1 gene
7. map enough genes so that you can look at a table (50-100?)
8. need some other kind of summary - transcriptome map
9. max qtl on x-axis, gene pos on y
10. provide script and data to run, LOD object = 120000markers by 20k genes - find peaks; do not run in class
11. make real transcriptome map - cis vs trans qtl - gene regulation, big vs. small LODs; trans bands - transcription factors
12. mediation analysis and causal models
